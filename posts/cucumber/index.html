                  So, here is "Cucumber" &mdash; my very own commenting system.
                  Still in the works...  As of today (20 May, 2015), users can
                  login via Facebook, Google, or Github, and leave comments,
                  but can't remove comments yet. It's open source, so you can
                  feel free to edit code in the css and js and whatever. I'm
                  using Firebase to store my data. A little bit of a learning
                  curve, but I plan to post a tutorial to teach you how to set
                  up your own cucumber-firebase commenting system. Eventually,
                  I would love to add inline commenting features, as well as
                  image / video posting capabilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I'm calling this "Cucumber" because I though of calling it
                  "Qcomber" at first, because it was like "quick
                  comments"...&nbsp; But I thought that was lame. So,
                  "Cucumber" it is!
                </p>
                <p>
                  I think Disqus is cool, but I just feel like it's a lot of
                  clutter. And I don't like the idea of signing in through
                  Disqus. Why can't I just sign in through the usual social
                  media??? Speaking of which, the procedure of adding other
                  social media (like Twitter) to sign in is pretty similar to
                  the rest.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, drop me a line or a comment or whatever...
                </p>
                <hr/>

                <h1>Tutorial</h1>
                <p>
                  To use cucumber, you will first need (1) a Firebase account,
                  and (2) Facebook / Google / Github apps. Then, all you need to
                  do is reference the relevant javascript and css files.  I will
                  walk you through the set-up of the firebase account and google
                  app, and direct you to a github repository for a simple demo.
                  The rest should be quite easy to figure out. But feel free to
                  leave me a comment, if you so desire.
                </p>
                <h2>Firebase Account</h2>
                <p>
                  If you don't already have one, you should first <a href='https://www.firebase.com/login/' target='_blank'> set up a firebase
                  account</a>. Firebase is a realtime database that allows
                  users to easily authenticate through Facebook, Google,
                  Github, Twitter, or email and password. 
                </p>
                <img src='img/firelogin.png'>
                <h2>Firebase App</h2>
                <p>
                  Next, you should create a firebase app. That sounds really
                  complicated, right? But it's really just naming things. It's
                  like setting up an email account. Just go to your firebase
                  account and look for this page:
                </p>
                <img src='img/fireapp.png'>
                <p>
                  Then in the "CREATE NEW APP" box under App Names, type a name
                  for your app. (e.g. 'Cucumber'). You don't need to bother
                  filling out the URL, it does it automatically assuming you do
                  it right the first time.
                <h2>Firebase Rules</h2>
                <p>
                  Firebase rules protect users data from other users. For
                  example, by specifying a set of rules, you can allow
                  authenticated users to write comments, and edit their own
                  comments, and prevent users from editing other users'
                  comments. The set of rules I used are:
                </p>
                <div id="cucumberRules"></div>
                <p>
                  So, just navigate to your "Security and Rules" tab, on your
                  app, and paste the rules. My rules allow the world to view
                  comments, but only authenticated users can write comments.
                  Furthermore, you can only edit and remove your own comments.
                  duh!
                </p>
                <img src='img/rules.png'>

                <h2>Login &amp; Authentication</h2>
                <p>
                  Next, go to the "Login &amp; Authentication" tab. To add
                  cucumber to your site, you will need to enter your website's
                  URL. Just the homepage will do. And at the bottom of the page,
                  go through each of the tabs and enable the services you want.
                  The screen below is what your page should look like for
                  enabling Google authentication.
                </p>
                <img src='img/authLogin.png'>

                <h2>Google App</h2>
                <p>
                  Last of all, to fill out the Google Client ID and Secret, you
                  simply click on 'Learn more' and follow the instructions under
                  'Configuring Your Application. The configuration should take
                  no more than 5 minutes. It's a short section, so don't skip
                  anything. Skipping may cause you grief.
                </p>

                <h2>Adding Cucumber Code</h2>
                <p>
                  And that's it for the apps. Now, all you need to do, is put
                the right chunks of code in the right places. So, just look at
                this <a href='https://github.com/luiarthur/luiarthur.github.io/tree/master/posts/cucumber/demo' target='_blank'>demo</a> 
                on my Github. And in '/js/cucumber.js', change 'luifireapp' to
                whatever you named your firebase app to be. Otherwise, your
                comments won't be showing up on your firebase app, but mine...
                And I will delete them!
                </p>
