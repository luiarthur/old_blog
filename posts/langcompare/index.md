Having used R for 3 years in college, I've gotten to know the limits and
conveniences of R. As a statistical package, with a large support community it
serves its purpose well. However, at times, especially when doing more
computation-heavy analysis, R slows down, and reaches memory limits. Hence,
I've been looking around for a language that is reasonalbly fast, and quick to
develop. Conciseness means less room for coding error (kind of) and usually
higher productivity. I checked out C, C++, Go, Scala, and Julia. And since my
computational work is usually Bayesian, I created my own criteria for judging
performance — a standard Bayesian multiple linear regression algorithm.

\\[\begin{array}{rrr}
   y|\beta & \sim & Normal(X\beta,\sigma^2I) \\\\
     \beta & \sim & Normal(0,100(X'X)^{-1}) \\\\
  \sigma^2 & \sim & Gamma(1,1) \\\\
\end{array}\\]
