    <h1>Learning New Languages can be Fun and Frustraing</h1>
    <p>
      As soon as school was out, I set out on a serach for more attactive
      interfaces and faster programming languages.  As a statistics student, I
      have used R a lot! And while R is easy to get around, I have learned that
      R has limitations (my concerns were mostly related to speed and memory).
      There is, of course, a trade off. For instance, when I was doing research
      on the Indian Buffet Process (IBP), a distribution used in Bayesian
      nonparametrics, I couldn't obtain a large number of draws quickly. But
      the algorithm was easy to code up. Still, obtaining a million draws was
      not gonna happen in R... 
    </p> 
    <p>
      You can do tons in R!  And R is really made to
      be a statistical package. So, I'm not going to stop using it. But, I need
      other tools to do things like getting a million draws from the IBP
      quickly too.
    </p>
    <p>
      So I began my search. I implemented a Bayesian multiple linear regression
      in R, timed it, then rewrote the code in several other languages. I
      merely tried in some languages, because it was just too difficult to
      write code in bayesian code in them... I implemented a bayesian algorithm
      because my interests are of a Bayesian nature. If you are Bayesian, and
      also searching for a language, I hope you may benefit from the coding
      examples.  Otherwise, why look here, you can probably go to <a
      href="http://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/compare.php?lang=scala&lang2=gpp"
      target="_blank">computer language benchmark games </a> or something to
      compare languages...
    </p>
    <p>
      I compared the following languages because I had heard about them and thought some features
      were attractive, or because I was somewhat exposed to them. I'll dive into details later. But
      for now, here we go!
