## Poetry

> I whispered, "I am too young", and then,

> go and love, young man."


## Here is some code: 

    # R code:
    x <- rnorm(100)
    y <- rnorm(100)
    plot(x,y)


## Other Stuff:

  - latex syntax conversion
      1. Greek letter: \\( \alpha \\)
      2. Inline math: \\(X'X^{-1}X'y\\)
      3. Display math: \\[X'X^{-1}X'y\\]
      4. regular letters in math mode: \\((x-a)(x-b)... (x-z) = ?\\)
  - need to figure out:
    - *program* **syntax** `highlighting`
