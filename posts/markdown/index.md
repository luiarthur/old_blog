## Brown Penny

> I WHISPERED, 'I am too young,'  
> And then, 'I am old enough';  
> Wherefore I threw a penny  
> To find out if I might love.  
> 'Go and love, go and love, young man,  
> If the lady be young and fair.'  
> Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny,  
> I am looped in the loops of her hair.  
> O love is the crooked thing,  
> There is nobody wise enough  
> To find out all that is in it,  
> For he would be thinking of love  
> Till the stars had run away  
> And the shadows eaten the moon.  
> Ah, penny, brown penny, brown penny,  
> One cannot begin it too soon.   
>
> *William Butler Yeats*
