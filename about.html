                I grew up in sub-tropical Hong Kong and did normal things 
                like play soccer all day, go to school, eat a ton of food,
                and playing the piano. I developed a liking for mathematics,
                and a love for classical music, in high school.
                </p>

                I arrived Brigham Young University - Hawaii in 2007, as a 
                freshman, clueless as to what I would study. I ended up
                studying piano with Stacey Mccarrey, and taking some math
                classes. Studying with Stacey has completely altered the 
                way I play. I always strive for the 'bell' sound she 
                encouraged me to create.

                After serving a 2-year mission for The Church of Jesus Christ
                of Latter-Day Saints, I returned to BYUH to stuydy the piano
                for another year before transfering to BYU Provo. At BYU,
                I eventually discovered a Statistics. I also took several
                courses about jazz music and have adopted the style in my
                playing.
                </p>

                In my free time, I like to learn and have fun. I aim for a
                balanced life. I like reading classic novels and YA books
                (though I haven't read very many at all).  I try to spend time
                at the piano every day. I particularly enjoy the music of
                Rachmaninoff and Bill Evans. Most mornings I rise and run. I
                try to avoid spending time on school / work on the weekends to
                recharge and do things like going to the movies, and being
                outdoors.
